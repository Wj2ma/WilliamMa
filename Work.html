    <div>Google Maps for Android</div>
    <div>Software Engineering Intern</div>
    <p>
        Working at Google has really brought perspective on what it's like working at a massive company. Maps is one of
        Google's most used products, and I felt really great to be given an opportunity to contribute to something that
        is so widely used. They have really similar benefits to Yahoo!, but work wise, I found that it takes
        significantly longer to develop a feature at a large company than a small one. The coding style guide is very
        strict, and I really found that to be a good thing. My coding style and ability has greatly improved from code
        reviews alone.

    <div>Polyvore Revenue Team</div>
    <div>Software Engineering Intern</div>
    <p>
        Polyvore has the best company culture I have experienced so far. It was also a huge jump for me, from living
        close to home for my whole life, to going out to the bay area. I didn't know how these tech companies supply you
        with delicious meals, an on-site gym, baristas on every building, and much more. I felt like I was living the
        dream. As for work, my team made an effort to give me meaningful tasks, such as adding cost-per-click
        monetizations, boosting the site's revenue by up to 10%.

    <div>Web/Mobile Developer Intern</div>
    <p>
        I joined this company to experience working at a super small startup of 8 people. Since it was so small, I was
        put in charge to recreate the whole chat system of the game. I learned how to design a huge project, and work
        on it end-to-end.

    <div>Agricultural Consultant</div>
    <div>Software Consultant Intern</div>
    <p>
        Working at Systemgroup was my first job ever. I was hired as a QA consultant, but after two weeks of training,
        they decided I would be a better fit as a developer. I picked up C# here, and that has been my goto language
        ever since.
