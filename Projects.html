                    So I got inspiration when I played this game where you had to click on moving targets on the screen.
                    I'm like, "hey, this game is really fun, and I really need to improve my mouse accuracy, so why not
                    make a game that focuses more on mouse accuracy then?" POOF! After a week of nonstop work in the
                    summer, this game was developed.
                    The most memorable thing I had in the development of this project was that I remembered how I
                    struggled so hard with animation of my previous Javelin Tosser game (and eventually gave up on
                    that), so I needed to get past that obstacle. Surprisingly, it didn't take me too long to get the
                    animation of a timer setting off on a target, as I was much more experienced.
                    Also, this project is where I invented my personal company, "Genesis," and created a trademark
                    splash intro that featured this glowing blue ball zooming across the screen, and then landing
                    in the center slowly, where the word Genesis would fade in underneath it. Furthermore, I had an
                    individual splash intro for the game itself, where it shows a cursor attempting to click all targets
                    on the screen before their timers run out. I was pretty proud of these splash intros, so please
                    take a look if you have time :)

                    Schematic-o-matic was my biggest project to date, with over 10,000 lines of code.
                    It was created for my grade 12 computer science summative, where you had to create a program
                    that was useful for another teacher.<br><br>
                    For the most part, the designing your circuit functionality was straightforward to code, but
                    figuring out how to develop the simulation part was one of the hardest tasks I have worked on.
                    Unfortunately, I didn't know anything about Kirchhoff's laws at the time, and I think that
                    knowledge could have helped greatly. I basically used a recursive approach to find connections
                    between all wires and their corresponding circuit parts or other wires. Then, when a power switch
                    is flipped on, I would start at the power, and then recursively go into all the connections to turn
                    them on, using the part's properties to figure out if it should give out current in its output.
                    The initial circuit creation would simulate fine and cleanly, but when the users start to
                    delete/move parts, and save and load the circuit, the algorithms I had in place to handle those
                    were extremely buggy and unstable, and I probably spent over 24 hours debugging and fixing those
                    issues. <br><br>
                    To this day, there are still bugs in the simulation from deleting and moving wires, but I thought
                    it was stable enough, and I do not have the time to try to understand what I was doing to fix it
                    now. However, again, this project was done just in my second year of starting computer science,
                    and I actually learned recursion maybe less than one month before the start of this project. For
                    my demo, I was able to showcase all the typical gates, but what was most satisfying, was that I
                    was able to successfully simulate flip flops. I built a simple memory circuit schematic that could
                    save bits of data. If you're interested, you can
                    <a target="_blank" class="inlineLink" href="https://github.com/Wj2ma/Schematic-o-matic">check out</a>
                    the program on my GitHub, and load the memory circuit to try it yourself. Please read the memory
                    circuit readme for further instructions.

                    My grade 11 computer science class was where I first learned how to code, and this
                    project was my summative for it. I began, knowing only how to use the basics of Java
                    (loops, conditions, variables, and objects), and spent a weekend learning how to use Java
                    Swing and AWT package to make a GUI game. With minimal knowledge, I slapped up this game
                    with top-notch art made in paint, even adding in a couple easter eggs after I finished.
                    Also, I remember struggling a lot with animating the javelin getting tossed, as it seemed
                    like no matter what I do, the canvas only repaints itself when the animation is finished.
                    Eventually, I just gave up and left it as a teleporting javelin, concluding my first ever cs
                    project. However, as poor as it is, it's one of the projects that I'm most proud of because
                    of my inexperience.
